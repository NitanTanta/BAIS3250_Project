# BAIS3250_Project (S&P 500 Stock Analysis)

As retail investing continues to rise, data-driven tools for evaluating stock performance are more important than ever. This project analyzes short-term trends in the S&P 500 by integrating data from TradingView (fundamentals), Yahoo Finance (historical prices), and Wikipedia (sector classifications). The objective is to uncover patterns in volume, volatility, and price movement across sectors to inform potential buy, sell, or hold decisions. The findings aim to support investors in understanding market behavior and sector performance.
